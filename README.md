# Griot Theater Mockup Homework

I started out (at least with the navbar), attempting to make the entire page responsive, but abandoned the task after the navbar because it was taking too long.

Also made sure to get practice in both flexbox and grid, as well as Bootstrap, so built different parts of the page using different components.

Used Bootstrap icons in both the "Info" section in the footer, as well as the "Social" section.

Lastly, rather than an image of the Chicago map area as seen in the example image provided for us to copy, I went ahead and embedded Google Maps at a 350x250 sizing, with The Bean as the focal point of the embedded map.
